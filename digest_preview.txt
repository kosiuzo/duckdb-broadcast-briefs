**2. Technologies Used:**

*   **Chat GPT:** The central technology, acting as an intelligent assistant.
    *   **Function:** Provides immediate answers to questions ("What’s the most compelling argument?"), generates links to relevant articles, and essentially serves as a rapid research and brainstorming tool.
*   **Document Editor (Windows):** The primary interface for working on content.

**3. Workflow Laid Out Step by Step:**

1.  **Question Formulation:** The user begins by formulating a question within Chat GPT (e.g., “What’s the most compelling argument?”).
2.  **Information Retrieval:** Chat GPT instantly provides responses and links to relevant articles.
3.  **Content Assembly:** The user then integrates the retrieved information into their document editor.
4.  **Iterative Refinement:**  The process continues iteratively, with Chat GPT providing ongoing support and suggestions.

**4. Strategies Used to Solve (Key Methodologies):**

*   **Rapid Information Synthesis:** The core strategy focuses on rapidly gathering and synthesizing information – replacing manual research with instant insights.
*   **Prompt-Driven Discovery:** Utilizing Chat GPT’s capabilities through carefully crafted prompts to direct the flow of information.

Title: How I built an Apple Watch workout app using Cursor and Xcode (with zero mobile-app experience)
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fD1PwltbuE
Transcript: data/transcripts/_fD1PwltbuE_How_I_built_an_Apple_Watch_workout_app_using_Cursor_and_Xcode__with_zero_mobile-app_experience_.md

Summary:
# Summary

Okay, here’s a concise summary of the AI video analysis, structured according to the provided categories:

**1. Problem Solved:**

*   **Core Challenge:** The primary challenge was inconsistency in gym workouts. Terry noticed a pattern of starting strong but slipping in consistency over time, leading to feeling unproductive.
*   **Ultimate Goal:** The goal was to create a system that would help users consistently track their workouts and maintain motivation, addressing the issue of “slacking” and losing momentum.

**2. Technologies Used:**

*   **GPT Mobile App (Speech to Text):** Used for real-time voice input, allowing users to dictate their workouts.
*   **Xcode:** Apple’s Integrated Development Environment (IDE) used for building the iOS mobile app.
*   **Cursor:** (Implied)  A coding tool Terry uses alongside Xcode – likely a code editor or IDE.
*   **Apple Watch & iPhone:** The primary devices for data collection and tracking.
*   **Apple Sign-In:**  A simplified login mechanism using Apple’s existing authentication system.

**3. Workflow Laid Out Step by Step:**

1.  **Voice Input:** The user speaks their workout details (e.g., “Dumbbell shrugs, 35lb dumbbells, 10 reps”) into the app using the GPT mobile app’s speech-to-text functionality.
2.  **Data Capture:** The app captures the spoken input and the associated exercise details (type, weight, reps, time).
3.  **Data Storage & Display:** The app stores the captured data in a structured format (likely a database) and displays it within the iOS app, visualizing workout history.
4.  **Multi-Device Sync:** Data is synchronized across the iPhone app and Apple Watch, allowing for tracking on both devices.

**4. Strategies Used to Solve (Key Methodologies):**

*   **Prompt Engineering (with GPT):** Terry leveraged GPT’s speech-to-text capabilities to create a seamless voice-controlled workout logging experience.
*   **Data Visualization:** The app presents workout data in a visual format (scatter plots, history views) to provide insights into progress and identify patterns.
*   **Actionable Insights:** By tracking workout history, users can identify periods of inconsistency and use this data to adjust their routines or set new goals.

**5. How to Think Agentically:**

*   **Agent as a Personal Trainer:** The app functions as a personal trainer, guiding users through their workouts and providing immediate feedback on their performance.
*   **Prompt Sensitivity:** The system's behavior is highly dependent on the quality of the prompts (voice input).  The prompt itself acts as a “bug surface” – a small change in the prompt could significantly impact the output (workout logging).
*   **Iterative Development:** Terry’s initial approach of using GPT as a speech-to-text engine and then building the app around it exemplifies an iterative agentic approach – starting with a core capability and then extending it to build a full solution.
*   **Trace Observability:**  The system provides trace observability by capturing every action during a workout, creating a log of the sequence of events.
*   **Transition Matrices:** (Implied) While not explicitly stated, the application likely relies on a transition matrix to map user actions (voice commands) to corresponding workout entries.

*   **ChatGPT (or similar Large Language Models - LLMs):**  Used as a foundational technology, potentially as a component within the workflow for question answering and prompt engineering.
*   **Abnormal Security’s Slack Agent:** Served as an inspiration for the design, demonstrating the value of a publicly accessible AI-powered question answering system.
*   **Glean APIs (and similar BI tools):**  Used to access and expose Amplitude's internal data sources (BI sources, documentation). This is a key integration point.
*   **VS Code, Cursor, Windsor:** (likely platforms for development and implementation).

**3. Workflow Laid Out Step by Step:**

1.  **Data Exposure:** Glean APIs are used to integrate data from various internal sources (BI, documentation) into a single, accessible system.
2.  **Question Answering:** Employees utilize the MODA tool (built around the LLM) to ask questions related to their work, leveraging the exposed data.
3.  **Prompt Engineering/Iteration:** Based on initial responses, prompts are refined and iterated upon to achieve desired outcomes.
4.  **Result Utilization:** Employees use the information generated by the system to build PRDs and contribute to product development.

**4. Strategies Used to Solve (Key Methodologies):**

*   **Social Engineering/Prompt Borrowing:** Inspired by Abnormal Security's Slack agent, the approach emphasizes making the AI system publicly accessible and encouraging prompt sharing and adoption.
*   **Lean Development/Rapid Prototyping:**  The project was built in spare time, demonstrating a focus on quick iteration and minimal overhead.
*   **Trust Calibration (Implicit):** While not explicitly stated, the design prioritizes providing accurate and reliable answers, building trust in the AI system’s capabilities.
*   **Binary Evals (Implicit):** The emphasis on structured data and focused queries suggests a desire for clear, definitive answers (moving towards binary outputs for validation).

**5. How to Think Agentically:**

*   **Agent-Based System Debugging:** The approach treats the AI system (MODA) as an agent. This means actively monitoring its behavior, understanding the “prompt surface” (the input prompts that trigger specific responses), and intervening when the agent produces unexpected or inaccurate results.
*   **Trace Observability:**  The focus on logging and tracking interactions is crucial for understanding how the system processes information and identifies potential issues.
*   **Transition Matrices:**  While not explicitly mentioned, a transition matrix could be used to visualize the relationships between prompts, AI responses, and downstream actions, facilitating debugging.
*   **Prompt as “Bug Surface”:**  Recognizing that the prompt itself is a key area for potential errors – variations in phrasing can significantly impact the AI’s output.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these sections, or perhaps provide more detail on a specific aspect (e.g., the architecture of the MODA tool)?
