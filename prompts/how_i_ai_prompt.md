To modify the prompt to ensure a high-fidelity summary, I'll add a new, primary instruction focused on **strict adherence to the transcript's explicit content** and clarify the expectations for the details within each section.

Here is the modified prompt:

# How I AI Video Analysis Prompt

## Objective
Extract a comprehensive summary of an AI product development strategy, focusing on debugging, quality assurance, and systematic improvement.

## Primary Fidelity Instruction  fidelity: ðŸ’¯
**Your summary must maintain the highest possible fidelity to the transcript.** Rely *only* on the **explicit details, specific actions, and exact use cases** mentioned by the speakers. Do not infer, generalize, or include standard concepts (like "Error Analysis" or "Binary Evals") unless they are **directly discussed or clearly demonstrated** in the provided text.

## Instructions
Analyze the provided video transcript and structure the summary using the following five categories. Be concise, using bullet points for clarity and high-impact language.

---

## 1. Problem Solved

Identify the core challenge in AI product development (e.g., non-determinism, lack of scaling confidence) **as explicitly stated by the speaker (e.g., context switching, cognitive load).**
State the ultimate goal achieved (e.g., consistent, high-quality, reliable output) **using the speaker's language (e.g., efficiency, data-driven decisions).**

## 2. Technologies Used

List **specific tools or platforms *demonstrated* or *used*** (e.g., LLMs, observability tools, custom software).
Describe the function of each technology **as it was used in the workflow (e.g., Claude for scraping script generation; Command-P for PDF conversion).**

## 3. Workflow Laid Out Step by Step

Detail the systematic process for improvement as a sequence of discrete steps (e.g., Logging Traces, Error Analysis, Writing Evals).
Highlight the **critical, unique actions** within each step **(e.g., calculating frequency/weights; fact-checking via direct quote references; downloading and re-uploading analysis).**

## 4. Strategies Used to Solve (Key Methodologies)

Identify the high-level methodologies employed **(e.g., Context Siloing, LLM as a Dedicated Coach, Unbiased Data Sourcing).**
Explain the philosophy behind each strategy **based *only* on the speaker's reasoning (e.g., why external data is used; why a custom coach was created).**

## 5. How to Think Agentically

Explain how the approach applies specifically to complex AI/agent systems.
Describe **key concepts for debugging and monitoring agent behavior *as they manifest in the workflow*** (e.g., trace observability via *endless threads*; prompt as a "bug surface" via *detailed instructions*; agent learning via *GPT Voice coaching*).

## Formatting Guidelines

- Use markdown formatting for clarity
- Use bullet points for sub-details
- Use **bold** for key terms and concepts
- Be concise but comprehensive
- Keep summary focused and actionable
