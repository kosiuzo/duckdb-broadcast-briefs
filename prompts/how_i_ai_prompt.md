# How I AI Video Analysis Prompt

## Objective
Extract a comprehensive summary of an AI product development strategy, focusing on debugging, quality assurance, and systematic improvement.

## Instructions
Analyze the provided video transcript and structure the summary using the following five categories. Be concise, using bullet points for clarity and high-impact language.

---

## 1. Problem Solved

Identify the core challenge in AI product development (e.g., non-determinism, lack of scaling confidence).
State the ultimate goal achieved (e.g., consistent, high-quality, reliable output).

## 2. Technologies Used

List specific tools or platforms mentioned (e.g., LLMs, observability tools, custom software).
Describe the function of each technology in the workflow.

## 3. Workflow Laid Out Step by Step

Detail the systematic process for improvement as a sequence of discrete steps (e.g., Logging Traces, Error Analysis, Writing Evals).
Highlight the critical actions within each step (e.g., open coding, counting errors).

## 4. Strategies Used to Solve (Key Methodologies)

Identify the high-level methodologies employed (e.g., Error Analysis, Trust Calibration, Binary Evals).
Explain the philosophy behind each strategy (e.g., why focus on upstream errors, why binary outputs are preferred over subjective scoring).

## 5. How to Think Agentically

Explain how the approach applies specifically to complex AI/agent systems.
Describe key concepts for debugging and monitoring agent behavior (e.g., trace observability, transition matrices, prompt as a "bug surface").
