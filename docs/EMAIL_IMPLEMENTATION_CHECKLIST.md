# Channel-Specific Email Implementation Checklist

## âœ… Implementation Complete

This document confirms that the channel-specific email digest feature has been fully implemented, tested, and documented.

---

## Core Implementation

### Email Configuration
- [x] Updated `EmailConfig` in `dbb/config.py`
  - Added `channel_recipients: Dict[str, List[str]]` field
  - Added `send_separate_emails: bool` flag
  - Maintained backward compatibility

- [x] Updated `config.yaml`
  - Configured `send_separate_emails: true`
  - Added `channel_recipients` with both channels
  - Included default `recipients` fallback

- [x] Updated `config.yaml.example`
  - Added documentation for new email features
  - Included examples of channel-specific recipients
  - Added explanation of separate vs combined modes

### Digest Rendering
- [x] Added `render_channel_digest()` method to `DigestRenderer` in `dbb/digest.py`
  - Renders single-channel digest with channel name as header
  - Converts markdown to HTML for email
  - Handles episode sorting and formatting
  - Includes CSS inlining for email compatibility

- [x] Updated `DigestSender.send_digest()` in `dbb/digest.py`
  - Added optional `recipients` parameter
  - Uses provided recipients or falls back to config default
  - Maintains original behavior when no recipients provided

### CLI Integration
- [x] Updated `digest` command in `dbb/cli.py`
  - Implemented logic to handle both separate and combined modes
  - Groups episodes by channel when `send_separate_emails: true`
  - Sends individual email per channel with appropriate recipients
  - Reports per-channel success/failure statistics
  - Maintains original combined digest behavior when `send_separate_emails: false`

### Email Templates
- [x] Created `templates/channel_digest.html` (255 lines)
  - Professional HTML email template for single channel
  - Includes channel name, date range, episode count
  - Beautiful episode cards with summaries
  - YouTube and transcript links
  - CSS optimized for email clients
  - CSS inlined by Premailer

- [x] Created `templates/channel_digest.txt` (plaintext template)
  - Clean plaintext format for recipients without HTML support
  - Includes all episode information
  - Numbered episodes for easy reference
  - Full summaries included
  - Links to resources

## Configuration

### Current Setup in config.yaml

```yaml
email:
  enabled: true
  from_name: "DBB Weekly"
  from_email: "${SMTP_USERNAME}"
  recipients:
    - "kosiuzodinma@gmail.com"  # Default/fallback
  send_separate_emails: true    # Enable per-channel mode
  channel_recipients:
    "How I AI": ["kosiuzodinma@gmail.com"]
    "The AI Daily Brief...": ["kosiuzodinma@gmail.com"]
```

### Key Configuration Options

| Option | Type | Default | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|---------|
| `send_separate_emails` | bool | `true` | Send one email per channel vs combined |
| `recipients` | list | `[]` | Default recipients (fallback) |
| `channel_recipients` | dict | `{}` | Channel-specific recipient mappings |

## How It Works

### Separate Email Mode (send_separate_emails: true)

```
User runs: dbb digest --send

â†“

1. Fetch recent episodes (7 days)
2. Group by channel
3. For each channel:
   - Filter episodes for channel
   - Render channel digest (HTML + text)
   - Get recipients from channel_recipients or default
   - Send email to those recipients
   - Report result (success/failed)
4. Summary: "Sent X emails, Y failed"
```

### Combined Digest Mode (send_separate_emails: false)

```
User runs: dbb digest --send

â†“

1. Fetch recent episodes (7 days)
2. Render combined digest (all channels)
3. Send to default recipients
4. Report result
```

---

## Configuration Examples

### Example 1: Different Recipients Per Channel

```yaml
channel_recipients:
  "How I AI":
    - "ai-devs@example.com"
    - "interested-users@example.com"
  "The AI Daily Brief":
    - "news-team@example.com"
```

### Example 2: Multiple Channels (3+)

```yaml
channel_recipients:
  "Channel 1": ["user1@example.com"]
  "Channel 2": ["user2@example.com", "user3@example.com"]
  "Channel 3": ["user4@example.com"]
  "Channel 4": ["default@example.com"]  # Uses default if not configured
```

### Example 3: Fallback Configuration

```yaml
recipients:
  - "fallback@example.com"

channel_recipients:
  "Popular Channel": ["special@example.com"]
  # All other channels use fallback recipients
```

---

## Email Output

### HTML Email Example

```
Subject: "How I AI Weekly Digest (2024-10-13 â€“ 2024-10-20)"

â”œâ”€ Header: "How I AI"
â”œâ”€ Metadata: "Weekly Digest â€¢ Oct 13 â€“ Oct 20"
â”œâ”€ Badge: "ðŸ“º 4 episodes this week"
â”œâ”€ Episode Cards (x4):
â”‚  â”œâ”€ Title
â”‚  â”œâ”€ Publication date
â”‚  â”œâ”€ Summary (HTML formatted)
â”‚  â”œâ”€ Links: Watch on YouTube, Transcript
â”œâ”€ Footer: "Generated by DBB"
```

### Plaintext Email Example

```
How I AI
========

4 episodes this week:

1. Episode Title 1
   Published: October 15, 2024

## Integration Points

### With Channel-Specific Prompts

- [x] Consistent formatting between digest and emails
- [x] Professional appearance aligned with channel content

## Performance Characteristics

| Aspect | Separate Emails | Combined Digest |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Speed | Slightly slower | Slightly faster |
| SMTP connections | One per channel | One total |
| Email count | One per channel | One total |
| Recipient experience | Focused | Comprehensive |
| Setup complexity | Moderate | Simple |

**Optimizations Applied**:
- Template caching
- CSS inlining only for email
- Efficient episode grouping
- Lazy recipient lookups

---

## Backward Compatibility

âœ… **Fully Backward Compatible**

- Old configurations still work (uses defaults)
- Original combined digest still available
- Existing template behavior preserved
- No breaking changes to existing code
- Optional configuration entirely optional

To use old behavior:
```yaml
send_separate_emails: false
recipients:
  - "everyone@example.com"
```
